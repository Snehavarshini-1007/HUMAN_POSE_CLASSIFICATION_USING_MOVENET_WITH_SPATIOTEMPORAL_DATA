# HUMAN_POSE_CLASSIFICATION_USING_MOVENET_WITH_SPATIOTEMPORAL_DATA 

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
 This miniproject focuses on detecting the human poses from the series of images and to classify them.This miniproject is done for the course Deep Learning and for efficiently classifying human pose images.

## FEATURES
- MOVENET ALGORITHM : This human pose detection is done using a algorithm called MoveNet
- DATASET DESCRIPTION : This model is trained using 1000 images and tested using nearly 500 images
